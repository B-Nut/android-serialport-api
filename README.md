Accessing serial ports for Android

I ported the previously Eclipse-based project to an Android Studio project.

To use this project you need to activate some SDK Tools in the Android SDK-Manager: "CMake", "LLDB", "NDK"

Maybe you don't need all of those, but I am too lazy to test that at this point.
